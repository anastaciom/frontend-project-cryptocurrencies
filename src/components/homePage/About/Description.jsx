          Hello, I'm Anastacio, I'm a Jr developer and I made this project to
          test my knowledge in ReactJS and NodeJS. The system consumes a
          Cryptocurrency API, in which it provides all the information about
          them. I always intend to implement something new around here. So stay
          tuned and have fun!!! ; )
